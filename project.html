                    <p>
                        The project “Parameter Assessment for Child Rescue from Borewell” focuses 
                        on the development of a system by employing a range of sensors and Arduino-based
                        control mechanisms.The Arduino Uno microcontroller serves as the central processing unit,
                        coordinating the actions of various sensors such as the ultrasonic sensor for measuring distance,
                        PIR sensor for detecting motion, DHT11 sensor for monitoring temperature and humidity,
                        and MQ135 sensor for detecting toxic gases. The data collected from these sensors is 
                        displayed on an LCD unit for realtime monitoring. The NRF24L01 module enables wireless
                        communication between the rescue system and a remote monitoring unit. Through the 
                        integration of these components, the project aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness 
                        of child rescue operations in borewell incidents.The system is comprised of two main components: 
                        a stationary Arduino Uno part and a mobile Arduino Uno part. The stationary part functions as a 
                        receiver, while the mobile part serves as a transmitter. The transmitter Arduino is inserted 
                        into the borewell and utilizes an L298N motor driver and a 10 rpm DC motor to descend down the borewell. 
                        An ultrasonic sensor HCSR04 detects obstacles, causing the transmitter to halt at a distance of 25 cm 
                        from the obstacle and initiate the environmental observation process.
